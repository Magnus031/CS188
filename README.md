# CS188
## Description
This is my solutions for the CS188 Lessons

## Progress
- Project0 Tutorial
	- Finished

> Project1 Actually need to make an great understanding with all the Search Algorithms, Like DFS, BFS, UCS, A* Search.
> Before do this Project, you'd better to read the Lecture Notes about Search Algorithms.


- Project1 Search
	- Finished

> Project2 is focus on some Algorithm about adversarial search like:
> - MiniMax
> - Alpha-Beta Pruning
> - Expectimax


- Project2 Multi-Agent Search
    - Finished

> Project3 is abstract that make me trapped in the trouble

- Project3 Logic and Classical Planning
	- **Finished Q1 - Q5**
    - TODO The Rest of the Project in the future


- Project4
